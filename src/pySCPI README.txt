1. Using pySCPI

pySCPI provides a GUI to allow users to send SCPI commands from a computer to Pumpkin modules that have SCPI capabilities, this section covers the basics of using this program.


################
A. Using the GUI

Load Commands:
This button allows previously saved commad lists to be imported into pySCPI to by used. This also imports other data such as the delays used.

View ReadMe:
This button displays this file in the GUI Output box.

Slave Device:
The dropdown box can be used to select from a range of supported Pumpking modules. Additionally the address can be modified directly in the text box but must maintain the format 0x__.

Intermessage Delay: 
This is the millisecond delay between I2C transactions sent from this program. This value can be changed as you see fit, short delays (<20ms) may cause bad data to be returned from telemetry requests so be wary of that.

ASCII Message Delay: 
This is the millisecond delay between sending and recieving an ASCII data request. As this data takes longer for the slave to process this delay should always be significantly longer than the Intermessage Delay; >100ms is a good place to start

Float DP: 
defines the number of decimal places to be used when displaying floats in the Output box.

Logging Period:
This the period in seconds at which commands should be sent when using the logging capability of pySCPI.

Input Commands:
This text box is where you should enter the commands that you want to be sent to the slave device. Commands should be entered one per line and can have whitespace separating them. When commands are saved or loaded the name of the file is use is shown to the right of the Input Commands title, and will stay there as long as the command list matches that file.

Save Commands:
This button will save the command list and associated delays as an xml file to be imported into the program again at a later date. These XML files are also compatible with Total Phase software provided by the Aardvark manufacturer.

Send Commands:
This button initiates I2C transmission through the Aardvark device, sending the requested commands with the given configuration. This button will remain green and disabled for the duration of the transmission.

Start Logging:
This button starts a logging loop that sends the command list at the rate defined by the logging period. This data is then saved to a csv file so that it can be imported into a data analysis program of your choice.

Stop Logging:
Once logging is underway this button can be used to stop the logging at the end of the next cycle.

Ouput:
This text box is where output from the program is written. This may take the form of data returned, system messages or errors produced. For common errors see section D.


################
B. Sending SCPI Commands

pySCPI can be used to send any supported SCPI command to a Pumpkin Module, these commands fall into two catagories; Commands and Telemetry Requests.

Commands:
A command in this context refers to the subset of SCPI commands that are not a request for telemetry, such as Starting the MCU Self tests or turing off the MCU status LED.

To send such a command it just needs to be typed into the 'Input Commands' box. A listing of these commands can be found in the supporting documentation for each specific module. Any command can be issued from pySCPI without altering the program configuration as no checking of command validity is done within the program.

Telemetry Requests:
Telemetry requests are SCPI commands that when recieved by a module cause it to load a certain data field into it's output buffer for the host to read. pySCPI takes care of both the sending of the command and the reading of the data. The time delay between read and write commands is defined by the Intermessage Delay and ASCII delay boxes in the GUI. The data recieved by pySCPI from the slave device is then formatted and displayed in the Output box. A listing of accepted telemetry requests can be found in the supporting documentation for each specific module.


################
C. Sending Aardvark Commands

pySCPI supports 6 possible Aardvark commands: four configuration commands and read and write commands for raw data. Any of these commands can be interleaved with SCPI commands in the Input Commands window, these commands that are denoted by the <> brackets that encompass them, are as follows:

DELAY:
This command allows an additional millisecond delay to be done at a given point in addition to the intermessage delay. For example to delay for 200ms the command would be <DELAY 200>.

ADDRESS:
This command allows the I2C address that is used for all subsequent commands to be changed. For example to change the I2C address to 0x55 the command would be <ADDRESS 0x55>.

PULLUPS:
This command allows the I2C pullups to be either turned on or turned off, this is done by sending either <PULLUPS ON> or <PULLUPS OFF>.

BITRATE:
This command allows the bitrate of the I2C transactions to be altered for all subsequent transactions. The system default bitrate is 100kHz, to change the bitrate to 200kHz for example the command would be <BITRATE 200>. There are a discrete set of bitrates that the Aardvark can be set to, when this command is issues the bitrate will be set to the closest setting below what was requested, for example if you ask for 215kHz the system will run at 210kHz, this is displayed in the ouput window.

READ:
This command executes a simple I2C read from a given address. For example <READ 2C, 4> will read 4 bytes of data from a device with the address 0x2C.

WRITE:
This command executes a simple I2C write of specified data to a given address. For Example <WRITE 2C, 44 55 9D 06> will write the four hexidecimal values 0x44, 0x55, 0x9D and 0x06 to the slace device with the address 0x2C, bytes will be sent in the order that they entered in the command. 


################
D. Logging

pySCPI allows the user to log data indefinately with a period defined using the 'Logging Period' field in the GUI. Logging can be started by clicking the 'Start Logging' button and then selecting the file to log to, and can then be stopped by clinking the green 'Stop Logging' button. The GUI will update it's display with each successive telemetry reading loop. 

Logging will write the output of all telemetry requests issued in the 'Input Commands' box to a .csv file that can then be imported into the data alaysis program of your choice. 

If the period requested is shorter than the time required to collect all telemetry then the logging period will be the amount of time taken to recieve all of the telemetry.


################
E. Common Issues

*** Requested delay is not valid, reverting to default ***
The delay entered is not a valid number.

*** Requested ascii delay is not valid, reverting to default ***
The ascii delay entered is not a valid number.

*** Invlaid address entered, reverting to device default ***
Make sure the address you entered matches the format 0x__

*** Requested logging period is not valid, reverting to default ***
The logging period entered is not a valid number.

*** Warning, logging period may be shorter than the dration of the commands requested ***
The logging period entered may be sorter than the time taken to sample all of the commands, therefore the logging period may be stretched to accommodate the data reading.

*** No file given to Load ***
The Load XML window was exited without selecting a file.

*** No Logging filename selected ***
The Start Logging window was exited without selecting a valid filename

*** No XML file written ***
The Save XML window was exited without saving.

*** No Aardvark is present ***
make sure you have an Aardvark connected to the computer you are using.

*** Requested XML file is open in another program ***
The file you are trying to save to is being used by another program, close the file or select a new filename to save to.

*** Requested log file is in use by another program ***
The file you are trying to log to is being used by another program, close the file or select a new filename to save to.

*** Aardvark is being used, disconnect other application or Aardvark device ***
You either have another program using the Aardvark or a pervious program exited without closing its connection. Ensure all other programs are closed and disconnect the Aardvark and then plug it back in again.

*** Command not found in dictionary ***
You are requesting telemetry that is not supproted by this pySCPI, a default format and length will be returned. Please check your command for accuracy and contact Pumpkin if you believe that command should be supported.

*** Read failed, Write flag = 0 ***
The Processor was not ready for your request, try increasing the Intermessage Delay and ensure that the Slave address is set correctly for the command you are sending.

*** The requested DELAY command is not valid. Use <DELAY x>***
The format of your DELAY command is incorrect, use the format <DELAY x> where x is the length of the delay in milliseconds eg. <DELAY 2000> for a 2000ms delay.

*** The requested ADDRESS command is not valid. Use <ADDRESS 0xYY>***
The format of the ADDRESS command that you issues is incorrect, use the format <ADDRESS 0xYY> where YY is the hexidecimal number of the addres	s you want to use eg <ADDRESS 0x55>.

*** The requested BITRATE command is not valid. Use <BITRATE x>***
The format of your BITRATE command is incorrect, use the format <BITRATE x> where x is the new bitrate in kHz eg. <BITRATE 200> for a 200kHz bitrate.

*** Invalid Pullup Command, use either <PULLUPS ON> or <PULLUPS OFF>***
This command only has two explicit options, use either <PULLUPS ON> or <PULLUPS OFF>.

*** The configuration command requested in not valid, refer to Read Me***
The configuration command that you issued was not supported see section 1.C for more information on supported commands.

Data is returned as Hex: 01 01 01 01 01 01 01....
The Aardvark is not able to communicate with the module, unsure everything is connected and the module is powered.
